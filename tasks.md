# Project Task Sequence

## Starting with Arrays Data Structure.
- [x] Design the layout for the visualization 
- [X] Design the Algo for the basic Bubble Sort Algo.
- [X] Design the `Psudo Code View Interactive tool` which will follow the algorithm
- [X] Design More Components to the swap logic like arrows pointer `(i,j,k)`
- [X] Add Insertion Sort 
- [X] Add Bubble Sort 
- [X] Add Selection Sort 
- [X] Add Quick Sort 
- [X] Add Merged Sort
- [X] Fix the bug that happen after re-clicking the sort btn once the array are sorted (pre-check the array weather it is sorted our not)

## Features that will done later for arrays after the above onces

- [X] Add the timeline that will show the current animation which can be interactive like play in `2x or 3x` for speed up the animation
- [X] Create an Constants variable that will tell about all the dimenstion.(fields values like width,height,borders,etc).
- [X] Final Task for this section `Create an document Page Blog page` that will guide the algoritms details 


## Starting the Recurrsion Tree Generations Tasks.
- [X] Design the layout for the visualization.

- [X] Design the Inputs for Recursion Code `(only recursive function)` and other parameter like Inputs

- [X] Make an `Input for the input parameters of the Recursive code`. to toggle the inputs more easily.

- [X] Create the function which will take the user function and collect the logs of each parameter,return values etc. To show the each function call states.

- [X] Collect the details of the function like function name,parameter list and return values which will be use in the later stage for information display 

- [X] Design the api for the Code running in and sandbox environment and informed the user about if any errors occur in the code at run time    



## Some Small Pending Tasks
- [X] Add the `Performance Metric` for the rest of the sorting Algorithm except for the Selection Sort which is done for the reference.
- [X] Add the support for the `Merged Sort algorithm`

## Utility Tasks
- [X] Document the code




## Currently implmenting (in the Recursive Endpoint)
- [X] Design the api for the Code running in and sandbox environment and informed the user about if any errors occur in the code at run time

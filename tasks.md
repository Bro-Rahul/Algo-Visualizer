# Project Task Sequence


## Design the UI for the Project.
- Design the Home Page layout for the Algo Visualizer
- Design the Genaralize Page for Each Algorithm like for Sorting there should an list of algorithm list like Bubble Sort, 

## Starting with Arrays Data Structure.
- [x] Design the layout for the visualization 
- [X] Design the Algo for the basic Bubble Sort Algo.
- [X] Design the `Psudo Code View Interactive tool` which will follow the algorithm
- [X] Design More Components to the swap logic like arrows pointer `(i,j,k)`
- [X] Add Insertion Sort 
- [X] Add Bubble Sort 
- [X] Add Selection Sort 
- Add Quick Sort 
- Add Merged Sort
- Fix the bug that happen after re-clicking the sort btn once the array are sorted (pre-check the array weather it is sorted our not)

## Features that will done later for arrays after the above onces

- Add the timeline that will show the current animation which can be interactive like play in `2x or 3x` for speed up the animation
- Create an Constants variable that will tell about all the dimenstion.(fields values like width,height,borders,etc).
- Final Task for this section `Create an document Page Blog page` that will guide the algoritms details 


## Starting the Recurrsion Tree Generations Tasks.
- Design the layout for the visualization.
 

## Utility Tasks
- Document the code
